## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  I can draw the conclusion that it would be most beneficial to launch a campaign in May. Conculding that the failed plays do not vary much based on launch date, letting me know that something else is affecting this outcome more. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? - My conclusion for this project is that the successful plays occurred with a goal of less than $1000. 
- 
- What are some limitations of this dataset? - This dataset is very limited to the information provided. For instance, we don't know what sports or game was played each time.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  The duration of the campaign and to the outcome of each campagin would be helpful.
